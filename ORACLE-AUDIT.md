# PostgreSQL oracle automation and boundary

## Automation decision

The oracle runs nightly and on manual dispatch in a `postgres:18` job
container. The container supplies the same PostgreSQL 18 `initdb`, `postgres`,
`pg_ctl`, `pg_basebackup`, and `psql` binaries that the local throwaway-cluster
path uses. The harness still creates and removes its own primary and standby;
it does not borrow the image entrypoint's server.

Measurements were taken on Ubuntu 24.04 on 2026-08-03 with the Docker and PGDG
caches initially cold:

| Route | Measured provisioning | Measured oracle | Decision |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `postgres:18` service | 6.07 s cold image pull plus 2.60 s to readiness | Not viable alone | The physical-slot audit still needs PostgreSQL 18 `pg_basebackup`, `pg_ctl`, `postgres`, and `psql` outside the provided primary. Moving those lifecycle operations across the container boundary would add code without removing the binary requirement. |
| PGDG on Ubuntu 24.04 | 34.29 s to add PGDG and install PostgreSQL 18.4 | 40.67 s locally, about 74.96 s combined | Preserves the harness but spends almost another oracle run provisioning packages. |
| `postgres:18` job container | 6.07 s cold pull; 42.17 s warm container start plus unchanged oracle, about 48.24 s combined | 41.36 s reported by the harness | Chosen. It preserves all lifecycle checks with no harness branch and no PGDG setup. Checkout, Node setup, and `npm ci` are common workflow overhead and are not included in these route measurements. |

This is a nightly audit rather than a push gate. Repeating a fixed-server audit
on every source push spends the same PostgreSQL startup and fixture cost, while
a nightly run bounds detection to one day and lets a moving `postgres:18` tag
audit a newly released minor. `workflow_dispatch` supports immediate checks
after a relevant claim change.

An unexpected result exits nonzero, makes the workflow red, and opens one
deduplicated `PostgreSQL oracle divergence` issue containing the pasteable
report and run link. Later failures update that issue; recovery comments on and
closes it. Four teaching-scale model defaults are explicitly registered and
reported as `REGISTERED DIVERGENCE`. They do not fail the audit; any other
difference, or an unexpected match of one of those four, does.

At measurement time the floating image supplied PostgreSQL 18.4 while
`CLAIM_VALUES.postgresqlVersion` named PostgreSQL 18.3. The resulting version
difference is intentionally actionable; it is not added to the four model
exceptions.

## Expansion result

The sentence that this whole scope was implemented was not true when this gap
audit began. The unchanged PostgreSQL 18 run made 211 observations: 207
matched, four were registered model divergences, and none were unexpected. A
check-name and SQL-path review gave these pre-fix verdicts:

| Registry claim | Pre-fix verdict | Concrete oracle evidence | Missing part |
|---|---|---|---|
| `walSegment` | PARTIAL | `WAL/default/SHOW-wal_segment_size`, `WAL/default/pg_control`, `WAL/default/segment-file-size`, `WAL/default/file-name-offset`, and the five `WAL/initdb-*`/qualification checks | `file-name-offset` accepted any 24-hex filename and in-range offset, and the measured segment file was not required to be the one containing the observed LSN. |
| `modelLatency` | IMPLEMENTED | `latency-wait/relation-lock`, `latency-wait/synchronous-replication`, `latency-wait/pool-slot-is-client-side` | — |
| `connectionPooler` | IMPLEMENTED | `connection-local/backend-identity`, `session-GUC`, `advisory-lock`, `sql-PREPARE`, `LISTEN-registration`, and `NOTIFY-delivery` | — |
| `workMem` | PARTIAL | `work_mem/sort-external-merge`, `per-node-sort-allowance`, `temp-file-counters`, `hash_mem_multiplier`, `concurrent-backends-multiply` | No plan contained multiple Hash nodes. The concurrency result counted active backends but did not require the concurrent phase itself to multiply temp files and bytes. |
| `restoreDrill` | IMPLEMENTED | `physical-backup/pg_verifybackup`, `physical-backup/cluster-wide-scope`, `PITR/row-witness-at-target`, `logical-restore/table-dependencies` | — |
| `timelineRecovery` | IMPLEMENTED | `timeline/latest-discovers-history`, `latest-excludes-parent-tail`, `current-stays-on-backup-timeline`, `latest-without-history-stays-current`, plus the two `PITR/*target*` checks | — |
| `vacuumReclaim` | IMPLEMENTED | `VACUUM/interior-space-stays-in-relation`, `reuses-interior-space`, `tail-truncation-lock`, `registry/vacuum-truncation-lock` | — |
| `mvccVocabulary` | PARTIAL | The `MVCC/*`, `page-layout/*`, `HOT/*`, `visibility-map/set-clear-set`, `xmin-horizon/*`, and `TOAST/*` families staged the named fields and states | Visibility bits were not connected to index-only heap fetches; inline TOAST reads were not observed; assigned-XID and prepared-transaction checks did not demonstrate retention and release; standby feedback only required a non-null field; logical-slot `catalog_xmin` had no cutoff comparison. |
| `machineSynchronousCommitComparison` | IMPLEMENTED | `synchronous_commit/off-acknowledges-before-local-flush`, `WAL-flushes-later`, `recent-acknowledged-loss`, `transaction-atomicity` | — |
| `machineIndexWalk` | PARTIAL | `partial-index/predicate-not-implied`, `predicate-implied`, `primary-key-plan` | The fixture used look-alike hard-coded SQL and accepted any single returned row instead of executing the owned Machine statements and comparing the seeded row values. |

The missing observations are now implemented. WAL filename and offset values are
calculated independently from the observed LSN, timeline and segment size, and
the measured file must be that exact current segment. The work-memory family now
includes `work_mem/per-node-hash-allowance`, and
`work_mem/concurrent-backends-multiply` requires per-backend temp-file growth.
The MVCC family adds `visibility-map/index-only-scan-effect`,
`TOAST/inline-read-path`, and `xmin-horizon/assigned-xid-removal`; the existing
prepared, logical-slot, and standby-feedback checks now test actual cutoff or
tuple-retention behavior. The Machine family executes statements owned by
`MACHINE_INDEX_WALK` and compares the exact seeded `{id: 42, balance: 1042}`
row.

The completed PostgreSQL 18.3 run made 215 observations in 79.26 seconds: 211
matched, four were the existing registered model divergences, and none were
unexpected. The changed WAL, work-memory, storage/MVCC, page-layout, and Machine
families also made 44 matching observations on PostgreSQL 13.23 in 21.06 seconds
and 44 on PostgreSQL 17.9 in 19.18 seconds. The table below is therefore the
implemented expansion boundary, not merely the intended one.

## PgBouncer mode spot oracle

PgBouncer was not installed system-wide. On 2026-08-05, the PGDG PgBouncer
1.25.2 package was downloaded and unpacked into a temporary directory, then run
against an isolated PostgreSQL 18.3 cluster with `default_pool_size = 1`. This
was a separate manual third-party oracle, not an observation made by the stock
PostgreSQL oracle above.

One client ran a query and stayed connected while a second client attempted to
use the one-server pool. Session mode kept the server assigned and the second
client remained queued. Transaction mode released the server after the first
client's autocommit transaction, but retained it while that client sat after a
separate `BEGIN`. Statement mode released after the autocommit query. A separate
`BEGIN` in statement mode returned `FATAL`, SQLSTATE `08P01`, with
`transaction blocks not allowed in statement pooling mode`; PgBouncer then
closed that client connection. The PgBouncer log recorded the same closure
reason.

The owned mode set and release boundaries remain cited to PgBouncer's official
configuration and feature documentation. The exact failure is additionally
tied to the tagged PgBouncer 1.25.2 rejection path and is labeled with that
verified version in reader-facing copy. Repository tests cover the city model
and cross-surface mode-set invariant; this manual spot oracle is not a nightly
PgBouncer compatibility matrix.

## Survey boundary

For this survey, **server-checkable** means a controlled fixture can obtain a
repeatable verdict from stock PostgreSQL 18, with PostgreSQL 13 and 17 used at
version boundaries, using shipped client utilities and bundled contrib
extensions. It does not include reading PostgreSQL source or
documentation, running PgBouncer/WAL-G/pgBackRest/PGlite, benchmarking elapsed
time, or checking PGSimCity's TypeScript and browser behavior. Those need a
different verifier even when the underlying prose is true.

The existing oracle already owns GUC values and contexts, catalog/view shapes,
wait-event names, `pg_stat_io` projections, Diagnose SQL executability, index
attributes, the registered model defaults, and its current MVCC/storage
experiments. The items below define the expansion boundary that the oracle now
implements.

### Server-checkable expansion scope

| Registry claim | Mechanically checkable remainder | Boundary inside the claim |
|---|---|---|
| `walSegment` | Compare `SHOW wal_segment_size`, `pg_control`, WAL file naming/offsets, and actual segment sizes in default and differently-initdb-d clusters. | The model's configured size remains a repository fact; unqualified fixed-size surfaces are reported when the alternate cluster contradicts them. |
| `modelLatency` | Stage coordinated relation-lock and synchronous-replication waits and verify the claimed `pg_stat_activity` type/name mapping; verify that pool wait is absent from PostgreSQL activity. | Model quantiles, the 512-trip window, phase attribution, batching, 30 Hz resolution, and the meaning of an `active`/null-wait sample are model or interpretive claims. |
| `connectionPooler` | With two server sessions, exercise the connection-local behavior beneath the warning: session GUCs, advisory locks, SQL `PREPARE`, and `LISTEN` stay with a backend, while `NOTIFY` can be sent. | PgBouncer defaults, pooling modes, admission, timeout, prepared-statement tracking, multiplexing, and all model scales require PgBouncer or PGSimCity, not a PostgreSQL server alone. |
| `workMem` | Use controlled plans with multiple Sort/Hash nodes to observe per-node memory, hash multiplication, temp spill, and concurrent-backend multiplication. | The existing default checks already cover `work_mem` and `hash_mem_multiplier`; the example MiB budgets, tenfold slowdown, fixed nodes, and absent planner features are model choices. |
| `restoreDrill` | Using PostgreSQL utilities, prove that a physical backup is cluster-wide, replay to a recovery target, run row witnesses, inspect `pg_verifybackup`, and demonstrate `pg_dump -t`/`pg_restore -t` dependency behavior. | Evidence ranks, cadence examples, modeled digests/three-block reads/time/cost, WAL-G, pgBackRest, credentials, endpoint cutover, and business correctness are outside a stock-server oracle. |
| `timelineRecovery` | Build a two-timeline archive and test `latest`/`current`, history-file discovery, use of a pre-fork backup, exclusion of a parent's post-fork tail, and reached/not-reached targets. | The default is already covered. One-fork model depth, plate copy, enumerated absences, credentials, and wider unsupported interactions are PGSimCity coverage claims. |
| `vacuumReclaim` | Create interior and trailing empty pages, run plain `VACUUM`, and compare free space and relation size to show reuse versus tail truncation. | The city's truncation timing and landfill geometry remain model checks. |
| `mvccVocabulary` | Extend the existing `pageinspect` work to stage creator/deleter/locker/MultiXact `xmin`/`xmax`, `ctid` update links, line-pointer states and sizes, tuple-header fields, HOT redirects, dead-versus-removable horizons, visibility-map set/clear effects, horizon constraints, and the exact external TOAST pointer size/read paths. | Source-layout declarations that cannot be exposed or inferred by the shipped server, prose completeness, and PGSimCity's drawn tuple/page geometry remain source or application review. |
| `machineSynchronousCommitComparison` | On a controlled server, observe `synchronous_commit = off` acknowledgment ahead of the local flush and later WAL flush; crash experiments can demonstrate possible recent acknowledged loss and transaction atomicity. | The model's route, its comparison receipt, the PGlite limitation, and an exact timing/loss bound are not deterministic server-oracle verdicts. |
| `machineIndexWalk` | Run the seeded statements to verify partial-predicate implication, returned rows, and target-version plan nodes for the owner and primary-key lookups. | The current oracle covers catalog attributes, not this measured sequence. The original PGlite receipt, buffer counts, one-connection sequencing, and replay disclosures require PGlite or application checks. |

### Not checkable against a PostgreSQL server

| Registry claim | Reason it belongs elsewhere |
|---|---|
| `appVersion` | Build metadata and its rendered surfaces are repository facts. |
| `bufferSample`, `bulkReadRing` | Frame counts and the fixed ring are teaching-scale simulation and visualization choices. The PostgreSQL `shared_buffers` default is already checked separately. |
| Remaining `checkpointPolicy` | The two model values are already registered divergences; the `partners` relationship is UI/model wiring. |
| `standbyNames` | `standbyA`/`standby_a` are PGSimCity identities, not PostgreSQL-defined names. |
| `modelDuration` | `model s`, `model ms`, and formatting are application units. |
| `cityComponentRoute`, `componentNaming`, `eventConvention` | URL, registry, bus, and browser conventions exist only in PGSimCity. |
| `diagnoseBranchGates` | The input views can be server-checked, but 20/25/30/55/92 percent and byte/second cutoffs are product heuristics, not PostgreSQL invariants. Branch wiring is an application test. |
| Remaining `postgresqlVersion` | The server version is already checked; manual URLs, source-branch strings, and cross-surface labels are repository/documentation checks. |
| `pgliteVersion` | PGlite provenance requires the package lock and a PGlite execution, not the PostgreSQL 18 server. |
| `markdownRendering` | Markdown behavior belongs to the UI renderer. |
| `reviewStatus` | Review-round counts and labels come from project history. |
| `postgresqlOracle` | This is the registry-to-tool wiring contract itself; its verifier is the test suite and workflow wiring, not the database. |

The rule for future additions is therefore: register a claim with the oracle
only when a stock target server can return a stable, exact observation for it.
Model calibration, product heuristics, third-party behavior, documentation
semantics, and UI/source conventions stay outside even if a server experiment
can illustrate them.
