# Diagnose — the symptom console

A second page in SSDSimCity, served at `/observability/`. It is not a map of the
`pg_stat_*` views. It is the other half of that idea: you start from a complaint
in plain language, the simulation is put into a state that produces it, and you
are walked to the view and the column that proves what is wrong — reading live
rows out of the running model at every step.

## Why it is not a diagram

The reference in this space is [Alexey Lesovsky's PostgreSQL Observability
map](https://pgstats.dev/), which maps every subsystem to the views and
functions that observe it. It is one glanceable image, it is printable, and it
is the product of a great deal of domain judgement. SSDSimCity is not going to
out-index it, and an earlier attempt to redraw it here was worse than the
original on the one axis that makes the original good.

But that diagram has a structural limit it can never escape: there is no
database behind it. It can tell you `pg_stat_replication.flush_lsn` exists and
what it means. It cannot show you a `flush_lsn` that is falling behind right now.

SSDSimCity has a server — `src/sim/model.ts`, a real PostgreSQL model with a
clock sweep, three WAL positions, WAL-triggered checkpoints, an xmin horizon and
two independently single-threaded standbys. That is the one asset this project
holds that no other Postgres learning resource has, and this page is built to
spend it.

## What is on the page

* **Eight complaints**, in the words people actually use: *everything is slow*,
  *writes stall every few minutes*, *a table keeps growing and VACUUM is not
  helping*, *the read replica is serving stale data*, and so on. Picking one
  stages the model into a configuration that produces that symptom, runs it
  forward ninety model-seconds so the cumulative counters mean something, and
  opens step one.
* **A decision tree** with about twenty steps and twenty verdicts. Each step
  asks one question, shows the SQL you would actually type, renders a **live
  result set** from the model in real column names, tells you what to look for,
  and lists the branches. Every branch carries a predicate over live state, so
  the tool evaluates them itself and marks the ones that are true this second.
* **Verdicts** that end at a diagnosis, live evidence, the mechanism, the fix,
  and the GUC you can turn right there — under its real name — plus a query to
  re-run and confirm the fix worked.
* **A verdict that grades itself.** Thirteen of the diagnoses re-run their own
  finding against live state and report `STILL PRESENT`, `RESOLVED`, or
  `NO EVIDENCE YET`, with the reading that decided it. This is the one thing a
  diagram structurally cannot do — it can tell you what is wrong and it cannot
  tell you whether you fixed it — and it is the reason the page is built on a
  running model rather than on a picture. The third state is not padding:
  counter-based views genuinely have nothing to say for the first few seconds
  after a reset, and grading an empty counter as a pass would be this page
  committing the exact error it spends a paragraph warning against.
* **An instrument list**: every view the model can serve, live, with the full
  verified column list, what changed in which release, and a PG version rail.
  Select PostgreSQL 15 and `pg_stat_io` and `pg_stat_checkpointer` become blind
  spots that say what you would use instead.
* **A cumulative ⇄ per-second toggle** and a working `SELECT pg_stat_reset()`,
  because "these are counters, not rates" is the most common misreading of
  `pg_stat_*` and it is impossible to teach in prose and trivial to teach with
  a switch.

## The honesty rules

These are hard constraints in the code, not aspirations.

1. **Names are real.** Every view, function, column and enum value — every
   `wait_event_type`/`wait_event` pair, every vacuum `phase` string, every
   `pg_stat_io` `object` and `context` value — was checked against
   the [PostgreSQL 18 manual](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/).
   A registered subset is additionally machine-checked against a live
   PostgreSQL 18.6 server by the oracle: the `pg_stat_*` view column shapes,
   the registered `wait_event_type`/`wait_event` pairs, and the `pg_stat_io`
   `object` and `context` values this page emits. The vacuum phase strings
   and the six non-`pg_stat_*` catalog entries are manual-checked only.
   Where a
   name changed between releases the change is recorded and shown. The
   capitalisation counts: PostgreSQL 17 began generating the wait event list
   from a table and normalised it on the way through, so the WAL flush wait is
   `WALSync` on 16 and older and `WalSync` from 17 on. This page says `WalSync`,
   and says why.
2. **The query above a table is the query that produced it.** If a step prints a
   `WHERE` clause or an `ORDER BY`, the rows underneath honour it. A page whose
   whole argument is "these names are checkable" cannot afford a result set its
   own query would not have returned.
3. **Hand-computed ratios say "—" when there is nothing to divide.** `forced %`,
   `hit %` and `fpi share` are arithmetic on counters, not columns, and zero over
   zero is undefined rather than zero. This matters at precisely the moment the
   reader cares most — just after a fix and a `pg_stat_reset()` — where printing
   a reassuring green `0%` would be the page inventing a measurement.
4. **Numbers are the model's, and the page says so.** A column appears only if
   the model genuinely produces it. Nothing is padded with a plausible-looking
   figure. Each instrument carries a coverage badge — `live`, `partial` or
   `absent` — and the partial ones say exactly which columns the model cannot
   fill and why.
5. **Two counters are derived, and are labelled as derived.** `wal_bytes` is
   exact (it is the LSN advance); `wal_records` and `wal_fpi` are shaped by the
   model rather than measured, and the caption says so on the table itself.
6. **`pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_slru` are marked absent.** The model has
   no per-statement history and no SLRU counters, and the page will not fake
   them. That absence is instructive: `pg_stat_statements` is not installed by
   default on a real server either.

## Real PostgreSQL in Query flow

Query flow keeps the six deterministic model statements as its zero-download
path. A reader may explicitly load PGlite and type arbitrary SQL at a psql-like
prompt. That in-memory PostgreSQL owns parsing and validation, catalogs, results,
errors, and `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)`. Its plan is converted to
plain data and selects the closest route through the finite model grammar.

The source distinction is repeated in labels, borders and texture. Solid green
panels are measured by PostgreSQL; dashed cyan panels are scaled by the model.
The real plan's shared hit/read counters remain beside the model trace's
buffer-hit/read values so disagreement stays visible.

Plans and buffer counts come from a rolled-back `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` preflight; the
statement then runs for its result. PGlite has one connection. It cannot
demonstrate concurrency, lock contention, replication, or a standby, so those
remain modelled in the city. If its code, data, or WebAssembly asset is blocked,
the page states that model mode is active and leaves the six-statement path
working.

## Colour

The palette comes from `src/styles/tokens.css` via a single `@import`, and the
subsystem accents agree with `src/core/theme.ts`: WAL amber, checkpointer pink,
background writer teal, replication orange, vacuum violet, locks red. A reader
who has learned the city's colour language must not be misinformed by this page.
There is no remote font or CDN. The only runtime network calls are the aggregate,
cookie-free Plausible analytics documented in the top-level README plus the
same-origin PGlite assets fetched after explicit opt-in. Diagnose and the model
path work when either is blocked.

## Run

```bash
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173/observability/
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

`vite.config.ts` only adds this entry when `observability/index.html`,
`src/observability/main.ts` and `src/observability/style.css` all exist. Never
leave the tree with one of those missing.

## How you get here

The city links to this page from one HUD button (the bolt icon, next to the
tour and the command palette). That single link in `src/ui/hud.ts` is the only
edit this feature makes outside `observability/**` and `src/observability/**`.
It is a plain `<a href="observability/">` — relative, so it survives being
served from `/SSDSimCity/` on GitHub Pages — and it needs no wiring because the
console runs its own instance of the simulation.

Every verdict links back the other way, into the city component that implements
the mechanism, via `../#/c/<component-id>`.

## Known limits

* PGlite is a single-connection PostgreSQL. It cannot teach concurrency, lock
  contention, replication, or standby behaviour; the Query flow says so beside
  the opt-in control.
* The model has one global xmin horizon rather than a per-session
  `backend_xmin`, so on the bloat path the abandoned session is that held
  snapshot drawn as the session holding it. Its age and its xmin are real; the
  table caption says so.
* There is no `autovacuum worker` row in `pg_stat_io` because the model does not
  attribute vacuum's own I/O separately. On a real server there would be one.
* The Diagnose projection of `pg_replication_slots` does not expose
  `wal_status = 'unreserved'` or `'lost'`. The wider model can now drop a
  physical standby slot under retention pressure and show its rebuild, but that
  operator scenario is not yet a complaint path or result row on this page.
* The page shares a JavaScript chunk with the city that still carries part of
  three.js, because `src/sim/model.ts` imports `src/world/layout.ts` for its
  table definitions. Moving those definitions to a renderer-free module would
  shrink this page; that change is outside this feature's files.
* The eight complaints cover failures this interface can currently diagnose.
  Transaction ID wraparound, slot loss, a bad plan after missing ANALYZE, and
  temp-file spill are absent rather than faked. Slot loss now exists in the
  wider operator model; the other three still need model support before they can
  become honest Diagnose paths.

## Layout note, recorded because it was a real bug

`#app` states `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)` explicitly. Left implicit
the single column is an `auto` track, which takes its growth limit from
max-content — and the max-content of the top bar is the six vitals at their
minimum width, about 806px. On a 390px phone the track sized to 806, and since
`body` clips overflow the excess was not scrolled to, it was *destroyed*: the
right-hand third of every row, including half of each complaint, ceased to
exist with no scrollbar to reveal it. The old page failed the same test at
900px. Check narrow widths before shipping anything here.
