Each ordinary pooled backend visit represents a batch of one or more single-statement transactions, sized from the offered rate. The model realizes constituent transaction and statement boundaries together at the end of that visit, except that a read-only sequential-scan batch releases commits as each relation-sized unit of work completes so the aggregate visit cannot hide minutes of completions. Transaction and statement modes therefore have the same queue timing in this workload, while statement mode still rejects the city’s two open-transaction controls; the model does not fabricate a timing difference between them. The tps control is aggregate work assigned to the admitted cohort, so changing refused socket count alone does not rescale it; session mode admits only the bound sessions’ share. The connection-storm scenario’s uncalibrated pressure curve follows active PostgreSQL backends only. Production session-lifetime distributions, client identities, reconnect backoff and all session-level SQL state are absent; queue time is a modelled client-side estimate, not a PgBouncer timing sample.',
