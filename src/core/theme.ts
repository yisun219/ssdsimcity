/**
 * SSDSimCity palette — LIVE. Three modes share one object.
 *
 * NIGHT (the authoring baseline): the renderer uses ACESFilmic tone mapping and
 * the bloom pass runs with a high threshold, so *only* surfaces whose output
 * exceeds ~1.0 will glow. Paint structure with `mat()` (PBR, no glow); paint
 * meaning — data, state, energy — with `neon()`.
 *
 * DAY: the same call sites, a different rendering model. `mat()` becomes light
 * stone and reflective machinery lit by a low warm sun; `neon()` becomes a
 * flat poster fill that carries meaning without any glow, because bloom is off;
 * `line()` becomes the cartoon's ink. Nothing in src/world has to know.
 *
 * LOCAL TIME: the same night-to-day translations follow an approximate local
 * clock sun path. It deliberately has no geolocation, latitude or season.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this object is MUTATED IN PLACE by setThemeMode(). It always
 * *starts* on the night palette, even when the viewer's stored preference is
 * day — src/world is authored in night values, and every night value has a
 * day translation, but the reverse is not true (the translation clamps). So the
 * city is always built in night and then translated, which is what makes the
 * switch exact and reversible in both directions. See the note on
 * applyStoredThemeMode().
 *
 * A module that snapshots a colour at import time ("const RED =
 * COLOR.bufDirty") therefore holds a NIGHT value forever and will not follow
 * the mode. Read COLOR.* per frame instead, or paint through the theme cache,
 * or subscribe with onThemeMode().

/* ============================================================================
 * THE DAY SHADER — two injections, one hook.
 *
 * 1. STRUCTURAL LIGHTING.
 *    The standard material's direct lighting term is replaced at compile time,
 *    retaining the shared materials used throughout the city. A diffuse shoulder
 *    keeps curved equipment and chamfers readable; an unquantized GGX lobe
 *    separates metal from rough masonry. Shadow visibility has already been
 *    applied to directLight.color, so the cool indirect floor survives in shade.
 *
 * 2. PER-INSTANCE COLOUR.
 *    The plaza's 1024 page frames, the WAL insert ring, the lock partitions, the
 *    CLOG bits and every flow particle are drawn from per-instance colour
 *    buffers that their districts fill each frame from values snapshotted at
 *    import. Those are night values and this module cannot reach them — but it
 *    can reach the one material they all flow through.
 *
 *    The remap is the same inversion the palette performs by hand. At night
 *    brightness means "hot" because the background is black and an empty frame
 *    is nearly invisible; in daylight the background is pale, so *ink* means hot
 *    and an empty frame has to be the light thing. Luminance is therefore
 *    inverted into a printable band, chroma is normalised so a saturated hue
 *    survives the move, and colours that were merely dim collapse toward grey
 *    rather than becoming saturated — an unused buffer must read as empty, not
 *    as blue.
 *
 * customProgramCacheKey() returns the mode, so three recompiles once per switch
 * and never confuses the two programs.

 * THE SURFACE TERM — masonry response in both modes, for zero draw calls/bytes.
 *
 * From five metres a thirty-metre wall was one unbroken field of a single RGB
 * value: no course, no joint, no gradient, no noise, and therefore no way for a
 * viewer to know it was thirty metres and not three. This is what fixes that,
 * and it lives here rather than in the districts because this hook already owns
 * onBeforeCompile for every mat() material in the city.
 *
 * WHAT IT MAY DO. The one height signal affects albedo, roughness, and the
 * standard material's lighting normal. It never writes emissive or adds a
 * bright seam. Albedo contrast stays below eight percent and relief below
 * 1.2 cm, so structure acquires material response without acquiring meaning.
 *
 * WHERE IT MAY GO. Injection is guarded on <roughnessmap_fragment>, an anchor
 * that exists only in the standard/physical fragment shader — which is exactly
 * the set of materials mat() paints. Every neon() (MeshBasicMaterial), every
 * line(), the plaza's per-instance deck, the ground plate, the sky dome and the
 * backend window bands are ShaderMaterials or basic materials and are excluded
 * by construction, not by a list somebody has to maintain.
 *
 * PROJECTION. World-space triplanar, never UV: theme.box(1,1,1) is shared and
 * instances are scaled from 0.12 x 0.6 x 9 up to 38 x 0.2 x 42, a 300:1 stretch
 * that no UV scheme survives. The world face normal is recovered from the
 * screen-space derivatives of the world position, which is exact for the
 * faceted boxes this city is built from and saves carrying a second varying.
 *
 * BOTH MODES. Night gets it too. The term is multiplicative, so seven percent
 * of a near-black navy is seven percent — a whisper that only appears where a
 * district mood lamp grazes a wall, which is correct: night's job is silhouette
 * and neon.
