/* ============================================================================
 * THE COLLISION WORLD
 *
 * A pedestrian needs three answers, sixty times a second:
 *
 *   1. what is under my feet?          groundAt()
 *   2. can I move from here to there?  move()
 *   3. …without stopping dead on a kerb.
 *
 * The city is heavily instanced — 1024 shared-buffer tiles, 14 WAL segments,
 * five warehouses of pages — so colliding against meshes is out of the
 * question. Instead the static city is reduced ONCE, at build time, to a few
 * hundred axis-aligned boxes taken straight from the component registry, and
 * those boxes are bucketed into a uniform grid. The small set of animated
 * solids is resnapshotted into a separate live tier. A walker only ever tests
 * the handful of boxes in the cells it is standing in plus that live tier.
 *
 * WHY REGISTRY BOXES. Every district already publishes a pickable root per
 * component. `Box3.setFromObject` on that root is exactly the volume the user
 * sees, costs nothing at runtime, and means a district that grows a new
 * building gets collision for free. No district has to know this file exists.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SOLID — see DEFAULT_EXCLUDE_IDS below. The three that
 * matter: `world.ground` (it is the floor, and the floor is a *walkable*, not a
 * blocker), `shared.buffers` (1024 tiles whose heights change every frame with
 * usage_count; a 32x32 field of live-height blocks with 0.6 m gaps would make
 * the plaza deck impassable for a 0.7 m-wide human), and `storage.tempfiles`
 * (its registered object is a 2 m-tall invisible pick proxy around a visible
 * 0.36 m step-height bay). You walk *through* the buffer tiles. Standing inside
 * a lit buffer is the entire point of the feature.
 *
 * OVERSIZED CONTAINERS. A registered root is often a whole district: the
 * backend row is one group 224 m wide and 26 m tall. Boxing that would wall off
 * the north side of the city. Even a smaller compound building cannot be boxed
 * as one mass: its loose AABB contains valid standing space between protruding
 * parts, and the solver must allow a walker spawned there to escape. Containers
 * are therefore split into children, and instanced box batches into individual
 * instances. Recursion stops at `maxDepth` (default 4).
 *
 * …AND OVERSIZED *LEAVES*. Nine districts merge their whole structure into one
 * childless mesh (`standby.b.struct`, `recovery.ground.struct`, the WAL vault,
 * the planner lab…). Recursing into a leaf finds nothing, so those buildings
 * used to end up with no collider at all and you walked straight through them.
 * A leaf that is too big is therefore VOXELISED instead: one pass over its
 * triangles bins them into a coarse XZ grid, each occupied cell is tightened to
 * the geometry actually inside it, and every cell is re-run through classify()
 * so a painted apron still fails minThickness rather than becoming a kerb.
 * Cell-tight, so a low wing does not inherit the tower's roof.
 *
 * Nothing in groundAt() or move() allocates. The single exception is three's
 * own per-intersection record inside Raycaster.intersectObjects — the results
 * array itself is reused, and the ray, the vectors and the candidate buffers
 * are all hoisted to module scope.
