 * THE PEDESTRIAN
 *
 * Orbit shows you the city. Fly shows you the city faster. Neither of them can
 * teach you what it is like to be 1.7 m tall inside shared_buffers while the
 * clock sweep goes past overhead. This is the third camera: a body.
 *
 * It is a kinematic capsule, not a physics object. Horizontal velocity chases a
 * target velocity at a fixed acceleration — 28 m/s² on the ground so a change
 * of direction is instant, 5 m/s² in the air so a jump is a decision you commit
 * to. Vertical motion is one number and a gravity of 22 m/s², which is more
 * than Earth on purpose: at 9.8 a first-person jump hangs like the Moon.
 *
 * Head bob is driven by DISTANCE TRAVELLED, not by time. That single choice is
 * why it stops dead when you stop, why it slows down when you edge sideways
 * along a railing, and why running does not look like walking played fast.
 *
 * Nothing here allocates per frame. Everything mutable is hoisted.
