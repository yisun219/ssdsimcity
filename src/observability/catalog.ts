/* ============================================================================
 * THE INSTRUMENT CATALOG
 *
 * Every name in this file targets the PostgreSQL 18 major line and was checked
 * against its manual; default-value claims use the reviewed 18.6 release. If a
 * column, view, function or enum value appears here, it exists. Where a name
 * changed between releases the change is recorded in `version`, because a
 * reader on 15 who copies an 18 query and gets "column does not exist" has been
 * failed by us, not by their server.
 *
 * `coverage` is the honesty field. SSDSimCity is a model, not a server:
 *   live    — every column shown is produced by the running model
 *   partial — the view is real, the model fills some columns and blanks others
 *   absent  — the view is real and the model has nothing to put in it
 * Nothing in this project ever invents a number to fill a column.
