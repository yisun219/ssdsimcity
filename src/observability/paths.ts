 * DIAGNOSTIC PATHS
 *
 * A catalogue of statistics views answers "what exists". Nobody arrives with
 * that question. They arrive with "the database is slow", and the fifty views
 * exist because each one answers some *other* question that eventually gets you
 * there. This file is that second thing: a decision tree that starts from a
 * complaint in the user's own words and ends at a column.
 *
 * Every branch carries a predicate over live model state, so the tool does not
 * merely list the possibilities — it evaluates them against the database that
 * is running behind the page and marks the one that is true this second.
 *
 * Copy rules, inherited from src/sim/scenarios.ts: say what is happening, say
 * why, say what an operator would do. No hedging. The reader is a strong
 * engineer who has simply never had to run a database at 3 a.m.
