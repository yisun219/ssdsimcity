/* ============================================================================
 * SSDSimCity — THE SIMULATION
 *
 * This file is the engine. Everything the city draws is a projection of the
 * state produced here, so the rules below are meant to be *true*, not pretty:
 * the clock sweep really sweeps, the backend really writes out its own victim
 * page when shared_buffers is too small, full-page writes really explode right
 * after a checkpoint, and an old snapshot really does stop vacuum dead.
 *
 * THREE HONEST DISTORTIONS, all deliberate:
 *
 *  1. BACKEND LIFECYCLE TIME IS STRETCHED for anything sub-second. A real
 *     parse is ~50µs and a real fsync is ~1ms; at 60fps you would never see
 *     either. Those durations are a monotone stretch (~100x) of the real one,
 *     so the *shape* is faithful while the absolute numbers are theatre.
 *     Replication packet travel uses its own smaller 6x visual stretch, but
 *     configured network delay and replay_lag are converted back to real
 *     seconds at every readout. Rates (tps, bytes/sec, LSNs) are not stretched.
 *
 *  2. THE CITY IS A SCALE MODEL. The plaza samples at most 1,024 frames from
 *     the logical shared_buffers pool, alongside 16 backend slots and 14 visible
 *     WAL segments. To let 16 towers represent thousands of transactions per
 *     second, one trip through the backend state machine carries `batch`
 *     transactions, and all work (pages touched, WAL bytes, dead tuples) is
 *     multiplied by that batch, so the pool and the WAL see the real pressure.
 *     Sequential-scan batches release read-only commits as each relation-sized
 *     unit of work completes. Keeping all of those completion boundaries at
 *     the end made legal cold-cache loads report zero commits for minutes.
 *     The latency instrument retains one weighted observation for that whole
 *     trip, so it does not model variance among transactions inside a batch.
 *     At the city's 30 Hz integration step those observations are quantized to
 *     33.33 model ms.
 *
 *     `batch` is a fixed FUNCTION OF THE OFFERED RATE — `tps / NOMINAL_TRIPS` —
 *     and nothing else. It is deliberately NOT a controller. Sizing it from the
 *     measured trip rate closed a feedback loop that cancelled every bottleneck
 *     in the model: slow trips produced proportionally bigger batches, so
 *     achieved tps tracked the tps knob at 0.90–1.00 with shared_buffers at 32,
 *     with 78% of backend-seconds parked in `blocked`, and at 50,000 offered
 *     tps. PostgreSQL has no such compensator. Achieved throughput here is
 *     `trips/s * batch` and is therefore an OUTPUT: it falls in exact
 *     proportion to any slowdown in the trip loop, and it saturates when the
 *     fleet is full.
 *
 *     One corollary, and it is load-bearing: the page STREAM a trip pushes
 *     through the pool is sampled at MAX_VISIT_PAGES, because the city cannot
 *     animate a hundred thousand buffer requests inside one trip — but the TIME
 *     that trip costs is charged on the unsampled amount (`work` in
 *     beginExec()). Charge the time on the sampled count and every transaction
 *     in the batch past the cap is free, which is the batch controller's bug
 *     rebuilt out of a different part. Anything that samples for the animation's
 *     sake must leave the cost alone.
 *
 *  3. THE OPENING WAL SEGMENT IS STAGED NEAR COMPLETION. The city opens 92%
 *     into a real 16 MiB segment, before its silent 14-second warm-up, so a
 *     reader can watch the remaining bytes close and enter archive_command.
 *     Only the starting LSN is staged: WAL rates, LSN deltas, segment size,
 *     max_wal_size arithmetic, and later segment fill remain unscaled.
