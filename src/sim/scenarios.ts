 * SSDSimCity — GUIDED SCENARIOS
 *
 * Each scenario is a lesson: a set of knobs that provokes one specific, real
 * Postgres behaviour, a place to point the camera, and narration beats timed
 * to when the city actually shows it. Beats are `[atSecond, title, body]` and
 * are fired by sim.runScenario through the bus 'narrate' event.
 *
 * Copy rules: say what is happening, say why, say what an operator would do.
 * No hedging, no marketing. The reader is a strong engineer who has simply
 * never had to run a database.
 *
 * `focus` must be one of the registered component ids:
 *   postmaster, backend.row, shared.buffers, wal.buffers, walwriter, wal.vault,
 *   checkpointer, bgwriter, autovac.launcher, storage.datadir, walsender,
 *   replica.standby, lock.manager, proc.array, clog.slru
