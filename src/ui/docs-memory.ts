Pinning also bumps the frame usage count, which saturates at 5. Pins are the reason a hot page never gets evicted mid-scan, and a page somebody else has pinned is the reason vacuum sometimes leaves dead tuples behind: pruning a page needs a *cleanup lock* — the exclusive content lock plus the only pin on the frame — so a page still pinned when vacuum arrives, classically by a cursor paused on it, keeps its corpses until a later pass.',

Avoiding it is exactly the job of the checkpointer and the background writer.

Buffer-pool capacity does not determine how many pages are dirty: workload, background writing, checkpoint pacing and dirtying rate do. Do not tune to a hit ratio — a 99% hit ratio on a badly estimated plan reading a million pages is worse than 90% on a plan reading a hundred. PostgreSQL 18 also protects the pool during a large sequential scan with a bulk-read ring: `GetAccessStrategy(BAS_BULKREAD)` starts at 256 KiB, adds space for `io_combine_limit × effective_io_concurrency`, and applies pin and one-eighth-of-`shared_buffers` caps.

From those, the planner estimates what fraction of rows each qualifier will pass, multiplies its way up the tree, and gets a row count for every node.
