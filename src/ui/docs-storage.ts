A genuinely dead tuple can only be **removed** if no snapshot anywhere could still need it. Vacuum computes a horizon from the oldest running transaction, the oldest replication slot xmin, and (if enabled) standby feedback; anything newer than that horizon stays, however dead it is. This is the mechanism behind the single most common Postgres incident: one forgotten `idle in transaction` session pins the horizon, every vacuum runs, does work, and removes nothing, and the table bloats for as long as that session stays open. `VACUUM VERBOSE` says so directly: on PostgreSQL 16 and later it prints a `tuples:` line ending "… are dead but not yet removable", followed by a `removable cutoff:` line giving the xid it was allowed to use and how many transactions old that already was when the run ended.',
