/* ============================================================================
 * SSDSimCity — THE GUIDED TOUR
 *
 * Fourteen chapters that tell one story: a connection arrives, becomes a
 * process, becomes a plan, reads a page, writes a WAL record, commits, gets
 * checkpointed, leaves a corpse behind, gets vacuumed — or does not — and ends
 * up on a second machine. Each chapter frames one component, may set knobs or
 * run a scenario to make its point, and hands the city back exactly as it
 * found it when the tour ends.
 *
 * The same lower-third card is reused for scenario narration when the tour is
 * NOT running, so the city only ever speaks in one voice.
 *
 * Keyboard: none of it is bound here. The HUD owns the single global key map;
 * its T key emits 'tour:start' / 'tour:stop', and its Escape handler offers the
 * key to every overlay first (through the shared { handled } payload) before
 * stopping the tour — which is exactly the precedence we want, so the palette
 * on top of the tour closes before the tour behind it does.
 *
 * Copy rules: two to four sentences, no jargon that has not been introduced,
 * and every chapter ends with something specific to watch.
 * ==========================================================================*/

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A chapter, plus the two things a cinematic needs that the frozen
 * TourChapter contract does not carry: mid-chapter knob beats (so chapter 11
 * can release the long-running transaction while you are still looking at it)
 * and mid-chapter camera moves (so chapter 12 can follow a WAL record from the
 * sender, across the wire, to the standby's startup process).
 *
 * CHAPTERS is exported as plain TourChapter[] — the extra fields are private
 * to the runner in this file.
