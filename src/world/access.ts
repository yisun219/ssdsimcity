/* ============================================================================
 * THE ACCESS DISTRICT — how a person on foot gets anywhere.
 *
 * SSDSimCity was laid out for a camera, and a camera can fly. A body cannot. A
 * survey of 4,600 world-space boxes found the city unwalkable for three
 * separate reasons, none of which is a step:
 *
 *   1. THE PLAZA IS AN ISLAND. The ground plate is cut away over CITY.pit, so
 *      the nearest solid ground is 40 m east/west and 42 m north/south of the
 *      deck edge, across a 52 m void. Not a step problem — a bridge problem.
 *   2. THE EXCAVATION HAS NO ROUTE IN OR OUT. 52 m of sheer wall, four times.
 *   3. THE DISTRICT PLINTHS ARE 0.60 m WITH A VERTICAL FACE, which is above the
 *      0.45 m step-up a walker gets, so every district is a walled compound.
 *
 * So this module builds, in one readable place, everything a pedestrian needs:
 *
 *   FOUR RAMPED CAUSEWAYS   1:14 to 1:16 clear-span trusses from solid ground
 *                           onto the plaza deck, one per side, each landing in
 *                           a gap opened in the deck railing (DECK_GATES, which
 *                           shmem.ts reads) and announced by a gate portal.
 *   THE DESCENT             a seven-flight switchback stair down the north-east
 *                           aisle of the excavation, ground level to the
 *                           data-directory floor at y = -52.
 *   THE RIM PARAPET         888 m of 0.9 m wall around the excavation, where
 *                           today there is a 52 m drop and a 0.07 m neon line.
 *   FIVE KERB RAMPS         one per district plinth.
 *   WAYFINDING              painted route lines on the ground in the colours
 *                           the legend already teaches, fingerposts at every
 *                           causeway head, named gates, and a sign on the
 *                           excavation floor telling you what is above you.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE MODULE. ground.ts owns the pit and shmem.ts owns the deck.
 * Access spans both and belongs to neither, and a pedestrian reading the source
 * should find every piece of their infrastructure in one file.
 *
 * ── THE COLLISION CONTRACT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * engine/collision.ts answers two questions: what is under my feet (a ray cast
 * against registered *walkables*, plus the tops of static boxes) and what stops
 * me (static boxes only). So this module publishes two things:
 *
 *   walkables   meshes the ground ray may hit. Slopes have to be raycast — an
 *               axis-aligned box cannot be tilted — so every ramp, stair flight
 *               and landing lives here, merged into as few meshes as possible
 *               because that ray is cast sixty times a second.
 *   blockers    axis-aligned boxes for everything a walker must not pass
 *               through: handrails, the parapet, portal columns. Sloped rails
 *               are cut into short segments so their collider hugs the ramp
 *               instead of boxing the whole air column above it.
 *
 * Nothing here is registered as a component, on purpose: the collision world
 * derives its static boxes from the component registry, and a registered
 * causeway would become one 44 x 3 x 7 m box — a wall across its own ramp.
 *
 * Everything is built once. update() does no work and allocates nothing.
